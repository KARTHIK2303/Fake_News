# Fake News Detection

This repository contains code for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset from Kaggle consisting of news articles labeled as either fake or real.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data)

## Code Overview

The code provided in this repository performs the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries and modules for data preprocessing and model training.
2. Load and explore the dataset using Pandas.
3. Perform data cleaning by removing missing values and unnecessary columns.
4. Apply text preprocessing techniques, including stemming, to the text data.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Vectorize the text data using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique.
7. Train different classification models, such as Decision Tree Classifier, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Passive Aggressive Classifier.
8. Evaluate the models' performance using the accuracy score.
9. Save the trained models and the TF-IDF vectorizer for future use.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Download the Kaggle dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Execute the code in your preferred Python environment.
4. Modify the code or parameters as needed for further experimentation or improvement.

## Future Work

There are several potential areas for future improvement and research in this project, including:

- Exploring advanced text processing techniques such as lemmatization, word embeddings, or topic modeling.
- Experimenting with different classification algorithms and ensemble methods.
- Incorporating additional features, such as metadata or linguistic features, to improve model performance.
- Conducting more extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.
